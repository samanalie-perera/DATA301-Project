# Background and Data

## Datasets
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) March 2005 - 2020 Mental Health - Depression Screener datasets.

## Source
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire

## Interest
We are interested in creating a machine learning model that finds and uses key features to identify individuals who are potentially suffering from depression. 

## Structure of the dataset
There are 17 variables in our dataset: 3 categorical variables and 14 numerical variables. Therefore, we will use 10 variables; each is a question the respondents need to answer to help us identify whether a person has depression.

## Steps to integrate the datasets

# Ethics, Privacy and Security 

## Ethical considerations
There are a number of ethical concerns that need to be considered when developing and deploying a machine learning algorithm that predicts if an individual is depressed. First, it is important to consider the potential impact of false positives and false negatives. If the algorithm incorrectly predicts that an individual is depressed, this could lead to them being unnecessarily treated or stigmatized. On the other hand, if the algorithm fails to predict that an individual is depressed, this could result in them not receiving the help they need. 

## Privacy concerns

## Security concerns
If the algorithm is made public via a data leak, then anyone could use it to find out which individuals are more likely to be depressed. This information could be used to target those individuals with ads or content that exploits their vulnerabilities. For example, an advertiser could show ads for antidepressant medications to someone who is predicted to be depressed.
