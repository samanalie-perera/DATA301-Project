# Background and Data

## Datasets
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) March 2005 - 2020 Mental Health - Depression Screener datasets.

## Source
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire

## Interest
Predicting depression in the NHANES Questionnaires data using a deep learning algorithm.

## Structure of the dataset
There are 17 variables in our dataset: 3 categorical variables and 14 numerical variables. Therefore, we will use 10 variables; each is a question the respondents need to answer to help us identify whether a person has depression.

## Compleness of the dataset

## Steps to integrate the datasets

# Ethics, Privacy and Security 

## Ethical considerations
There are a number of ethical concerns that need to be considered when developing and deploying a machine learning algorithm that predicts if an individual is depressed. First, it is important to consider the potential impact of false positives and false negatives. If the algorithm incorrectly predicts that an individual is depressed, this could lead to them being unnecessarily treated or stigmatized. On the other hand, if the algorithm fails to predict that an individual is depressed, this could result in them not receiving the help they need.
